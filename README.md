# Environmental Justice Dashboard

This is an environmental justice dashboard that will analyze the demographic and environmental variables within a given buffer range around inputted or preloaded data points.

## Description

We aim to create a dashboard that will allow the user to input a list of points (or select from a pre-loaded list on the website), and a buffer range. The points could be sites like trash incinerators, highways, hazardous waste sites, or other places that people may be interested in analyzing. The site will then use APIs to pull data within the buffer range around those points to analyze the demographic and environmental variables. Our goal is to show a series of charts and figures analyzing this data, which the user can download as a PDF

We are working with Dr. M. Anwar Sounny-Slitine from UF's Geography Department, and this project is part of the Florida Environmental Justice Project. The website we make will be part of his research, and will serve as both an educational tool and a research tool to analyze how the buffer range one inputs impacts the results of the demographics in the surrounding area.
